# Animal Extinction Timeline â€“ Stage 1

## Overview
This project displays a timeline of animal species that have gone extinct over history.  
Stage 1 focuses only on the HTML foundation.

## Structure
- **Header**: Logo + theme toggle.
- **Navigation**: Placeholder for filters (e.g., mammals, birds).
- **Main Content**: 
  - `<section id="timeline">` for event markers.
  - `<article>` entries for each extinct species.
- **Modal**: Empty `<div>` for future detailed pop-ups.
- **Semantic Tags**: Used for clean, accessible markup.

## Future Plans
- Add CSS for timeline layout and dark/light mode.
- Populate with real data and images.
- Implement filters and modal details.
